# 测试
Testing efforts in handling all variations, edge cases, and invalid inputs. 

## Black box
只关心behavior
- command line usage: missing arguments, wrong arguments
edge cases

## White box
Planning for the test cases needed to exercise all the code paths.

e.g. In control flow: if else 每种情况都要测试到

缺点: 有些情况人想不到，所以也不会设计类似的测试

## Stress Test
压力测试

## Regression Testing
为了检查出改完旧bug出现新bug，需要把旧的test再做一次

There are a variety of tools you can leverage to streamline and automate testing:

1. The **gdb debugger** is an excellent investment. For example, evaluating calls to functions within the debugger to do quick manual tests can be a big help.
2. Be sure to use **Valgrind** early and often. It is invaluable in spotting memory errors and reporting leaks that would be near impossible to find manually.
3. Our **sanity check** tool allows for simple comparison of the output your program with that of the sample solution. （检测输出是否符合预期）
4. (The Unix environment) has a variety of small useful tools, such as those that do file/text-processing tasks (``diff``, ``sort``, ``grep``, ``sed``, ``wc``, and so on) that you can combine.
